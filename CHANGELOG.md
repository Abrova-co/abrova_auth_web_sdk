## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-07

- `languageCode` and `useDeviceLanguage()`, like Firebase: the language of the e-mails Abrova sends this user
  (confirm e-mail, password reset, magic link), for example `auth.languageCode = 'fa'`. Unset, the project's template
  language from the Console applies. Also a `languageCode` option in the config.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-05

- `getTokenResult({ forceRefresh })`: the access token with its decoded fields, like Firebase's
  `getIdTokenResult()`. `claims` holds the custom claims your server set with `setCustomUserClaims`, at the top level
  (for example `plan`, `role`), plus `sub`, `iat`, `exp`, `auth_time` and `amr`; also `expirationTime`,
  `issuedAtTime`, `authTime` and `signInProvider`. For showing things in the app; access is still decided on the
  server. Pass `{ forceRefresh: true }` right after your server changed the claims.
- `decodeTokenPayload(token)` helper.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-20

- Sends `X-Abrova-SDK: auth-web/0.1.1` with every request so Abrova can show which SDK versions are in use. No behaviour
  change.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-16

- Initial release: anonymous, Apple, Google, e-mail + password, magic link and Telegram sign-in; linking a method to
  the signed-in user; `getMe`, `signOut`, `signOutEverywhere`, `deleteAccount`.
- Sessions refresh themselves (one request for concurrent callers); rotated refresh tokens are saved.
- Works with the other Abrova SDKs: `() => auth.getToken()` for Abrova Sync, Push and A/B Testing (null while signed
  out), `auth.tokenProvider` for Abrova Chat (rejects while signed out).
- Memory storage by default; opt-in `localStorageStorage()`.
- Example app in `example/`.
